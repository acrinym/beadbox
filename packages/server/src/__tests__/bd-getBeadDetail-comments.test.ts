// beadbox-a9l regression suite: detail-panel comments render via the
// version-stable `bd comments <id> --json` subcommand.
//
// THE BUG IT GUARDS AGAINST:
// `bd show <id> --json` omits comment bodies by default — the response
// has `comment_count` but `comments: null`. getBeadDetail used to read
// `(bdBead.comments || []).map(...)`, so the detail panel's comments
// section (gated on commentsCount > 0) never rendered for any bead with
// comments. The first fix attempt added `--include-comments` to bd show,
// but that flag is VERSION-GATED (newer bd only) and blew up on CI's
// older bd with a usage dump. The durable fix sources comment bodies
// from the dedicated `bd comments <id> --json` subcommand (getComments),
// which is stable across every bd version and runs in getBeadDetail's
// existing parallel batch (no added round-trip).
//
// This test exercises the PRODUCTION path — getBeadDetail — using only
// stable bd subcommands (`bd comments add`, then getBeadDetail's
// `bd comments --json` read), so it passes on CI's bd version, not just
// a newer local one.
//
// Coverage:
//   1. A bead with N comments → getBeadDetail returns N populated bodies.
//   2. Each comment carries id / author / content / timestamp.
//   3. A zero-comment bead → empty comments array (no spurious section).
